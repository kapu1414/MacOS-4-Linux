# MacOS-4-Linux
Those are my specs for the theme and confs for getting the appearance of a MacOS machine on Linux(cinnamon).
We'll have:
            1.Themes, those must be applied on the themes part on general settings.
            2.Fonts, we all love SF frontr from Apple, must create $.fonts on personal folder.
            3.On icons, we'll change the mouse and window settings
